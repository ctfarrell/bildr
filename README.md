# Bildr Alternate Assignment for ISYS 5453

# Description
Our class has an assignment for building a small web3 app with [bildr studio](https://bildr.com) to prep for an upcoming hackathon. I could use a lot more practice with typescript, react, and nextjs. Also I want to get started learning chakra ui so I'm doing the assignment here :grin:
