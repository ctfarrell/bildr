# Bildr Alternate Assignment for ISYS 5453

# Description
Our class has an assignment for building a small web3 app with [bildr studio](https://bildr.com) to prep for an upcoming hackathon. I could use a lot more practice with react, nextjs, and I want to get started learning chakra ui so I'm doing the assignment here :grin:
